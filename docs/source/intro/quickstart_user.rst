User Quickstart
=======================

pymunge is a command line tool that is able to process SWBF modding files and converting them into munged files.
Whenever you are in doubt have a look at the docs or try out ``pymunge --help`` for more information on how to use the tool.
You can also take a look at the section :ref:`sec-command-line-arguments` which provides an up-to-date table of all command line arguments and explanations.
